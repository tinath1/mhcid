<p class="cursive">I wish my handwriting looked like this. Loopy, slanted, and elegant. It is very clean and legible-for cursive writing.</p>

<p class="handwriting">My actual handwriting looks more like this. I like to write in all caps, but when I'm in a hurry, I tend to mix messy cursive with this type of writing. Caps take long to write in becuase the letters consist of short lines. You have to constantly draw a line and pick up your pencil to draw another one- which wastes time.</p></body>
<p class="type">
  This is a nice and simple font to read. It's easy on the eyes and unnoticable, which is good when I am reading something with important content.
